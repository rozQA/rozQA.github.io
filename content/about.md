## Background
Hello! My name is Wojciech Rózga, and I'm proud to be from the beautiful city of Szczecin, Poland. Born and raised here, I've always loved the vibrant culture and stunning scenery that make Szczecin such a unique and wonderful place.

I pursued my higher education at the West Pomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin, where I graduated with a degree in Computer Science. My thesis focused on the efficiency of test automation in multilayer applications, setting the stage for my future career.

## Career and experience
My career at Demant began in the summer of 2017 as a trainee, where I executed manual test cases and reported defects. After my internship ended in 2018, I was hired as a Junior Test Developer and soon took on the role of Scrum Master for the solution/release testing team.

Since 2021, I have been working as a Senior Test Architect at Demant. In this role, I am responsible for defining and implementing comprehensive test strategies and plans in collaboration with cross-functional teams, aligning testing with the overall product vision.

My responsibilities include providing technical guidance and expertise to ensure a clear understanding of testing objectives and methodologies across the team. I enhance and optimize the test repository by implementing effective solutions for continuous improvement. By utilizing my architectural skills, I support development teams in building robust and efficient solutions and features. Developing and executing testing strategies that address code complexity and system architecture to ensure overall system functionality is a critical part of my role.

I implement and maintain automation frameworks to facilitate efficient test automation and integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous testing and faster feedback loops. My involvement in planning and executing successful product releases is crucial, significantly contributing to the release function.

In a SAFe setup, I act as the Product Owner for solution testing teams, managing the backlog and prioritizing product quality. I collaborate with test managers and stakeholders to drive relentless improvement of testing processes. Additionally, I define and plan test strategies for various products, considering their specific needs and requirements, and provide expertise in verifying software at different stages of the application lifecycle.

During my daily work, I love to:
- Identify correlations between code and performance, helping me create effective testing strategies.
- Advocate for the power of automation to improve productivity and quality assurance.
- Explore new and innovative technological solutions to streamline testing processes.

## Final Thoughts
>Efficient software testing and passion to quality!

I live by the principles of dedication, innovation, and collaboration. My goal is to continually improve and contribute to the field of software testing, ensuring that products meet the highest standards of performance and reliability. Looking ahead, I aspire to take on more challenging roles that allow me to drive innovation and excellence in software quality assurance.
